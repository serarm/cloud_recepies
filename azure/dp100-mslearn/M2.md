# Microsoft Azure AI Fundamental: Explore Visual tool for Machine Learning

Two ways to do no code ML in Azure:
1. Automated Machine Learning
2. Azure machine Learning Designer

+ Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based service that helps simplify some of the tasks and reduce the time it takes to prepare data, train a model, and deploy a predictive service

> Steps for using Azure Machine Learning
1. Create workspace
2. Create compute targets: `Standard_DS11_v2`
3. There are 4 kind of compute target:
   + `Compute Instances`: Development workstations that data scientists can use to work with data and models.
   + `Compute Clusters`: Scalable clusters of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code.
   + `Inference Clusters`: Deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models.
   + `Attached Compute`: Links to existing Azure compute resources, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters.
3. Create compute cluster : Use `Standard_DS11_v2`
4. Create a dataset
5. Train a machine learning model
